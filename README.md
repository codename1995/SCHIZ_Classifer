# Effective schizophrenia recognition using discriminative eye movement features and model-metric based features

This repository contains an eye movement dataset and a classifer. 

The orignial dataset is avaliable now. 
The code of pre-processing and the classifer is coming soon.

## Dataset
### Original dataset
[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e71a7MW1uvniP0uG-GiOaR75a872xDGw/view?usp=sharing) is the original version of the dataset. Each folder contains three reports which come from the EYE-LINK software. 
### [Recommended] Processed dataset (Comming soon)
To make the dataset easy to use, we extracted the important information, *e.g.* fixation position and fixation duration, into MAT file.
